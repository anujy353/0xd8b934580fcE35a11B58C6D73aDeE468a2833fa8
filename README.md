## ðŸ•¹ Project Description

**MetaArena** is a decentralized, blockchain-based player registry and leaderboard system for gaming platforms. It allows users to register themselves with a unique username, and platform administrators to track and update player scores transparently and immutably using smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

## ðŸŒŸ Project Vision

To create a tamper-proof and transparent environment where gamers can:
- Register their unique identity.
- Compete fairly in various games.
- Showcase achievements and scores securely on-chain.

Our vision is to become the go-to platform for Web3-enabled gaming identity and scoring infrastructure.

## ðŸš€ Key Features

- **Player Registration:** Users can register their gaming identity on-chain.
- **Score Management:** Admins can update player scores securely.
- **Data Retrieval:** Public functions to fetch player profiles and scores.
- **Event Logging:** Real-time tracking of registration and score updates through emitted events.

## ðŸ”­ Future Scope

- **Integration with Game Engines (Unity/Web3.js):** Allow direct in-game interaction with the smart contract.
- **NFT Badges & Achievements:** Tokenized rewards for performance and milestones.
- **Leaderboard System:** Real-time sorting and ranking of players based on scores.
- **Multi-Game Support:** Allow players to have scores in multiple games with separate tracking.
- **Governance DAO:** Community voting for rule changes, player disputes, and game additions.
